# React Tour of Heroes

Using Angular 2's tutorial concepts to build a like application using React and TypeScript.

Follows Part 3 of the tutorial.  In this part of the tutorial Angular team started refactoring for reuse, testability and readability.  I had done that from the start.  There are no code updates in part 2 over part 3.
