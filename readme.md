# React Tour of Heroes

Using Angular 2's tutorial concepts to build a like application using React and TypeScript.

This project aims to replicate the functionality for compartive measures of the Angular 2 tutorial.  I hope that by using TypeScript and React an individual attempting to make a conclusion on whether to use React or Angular is made easier.  

Each branch of this project will be representative of the functionality that steps through the Angular 2 tutorial.
